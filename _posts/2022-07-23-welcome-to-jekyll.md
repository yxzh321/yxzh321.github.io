This is a brief summary of a research project for the course _Thermodynamics_ _and_ _Statistical_ _Mechanics_ this year (2022)@School of Physics, Nankai University, China.

The project was a group work while I was involved in most parts of theoretical work and completed the whole [simulation](https://github.com/yxzh321) .[^simulation] 

**_To_ _be_ _continued_...**

[^simulation]: Code is available on my github page.
